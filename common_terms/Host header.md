- The "Host" header is an HTTP request header used in Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) communications.
- It specifies the domain name of the target server or the network location of the resource being requested.
- This header enables virtual hosting, which allows multiple websites to be served from a single web server using a single IP address.

### Here's how the "Host" header works:

   **HTTP Request**: When a client (such as a web browser) makes an HTTP request to a server, it includes the "Host" header to indicate which domain or subdomain it is trying to access. For example:
```js
GET /page.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com   
```

In this example, the client is requesting the "page.html" resource from the "[www.example.com](http://www.example.com/)" website.
