## What is the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header?

   - The "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" header is like a website's way of saying, "You are allowed to use my stuff." It specifies which other websites are permitted to access and use its resources, like images or data.
   - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is a CORS header.
   - CORS, or Cross Origin Resource Sharing, is a mechanism for browsers to let a site running at origin A to request resources from origin B.
   - Origin is not just the hostname, but a combination of port, hostname and scheme, such as - `http://mysite.example.com:8080/`

#### Here's an example of where this comes into action -

   A web page from one website (Origin A) cannot easily request or access resources from another website (Origin B) due to security concerns. To make this possible, the website from Origin B needs to explicitly allow requests from Origin A by setting up something called "Cross-Origin Resource Sharing" (CORS) in its server configuration. Once CORS is set up, the browser will allow requests from Origin A to access resources on Origin B.
   
With the help of CORS, browsers allow origins to share resources amongst each other.

The key header for sharing resources between different websites is "Access-Control-Allow-Origin." It tells the browser which origins are permitted to make requests to this server.

## Access-Control-Allow-Origin with different values

 1. Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
	 - This header allows any origin, including websites hosted on different domains, to access the resources on the server. It essentially disables the same-origin policy and is the most permissive setting.
	 - Using `*` is not recommended for security reasons unless you intentionally want to allow any website to access your resources.

2. Access-Control-Allow-Origin: null
	 - Specifying "null" as the allowed origin means that only web pages served from the same origin (the same domain) as the server can access the resources.
	 - It is a highly restrictive setting, and it's not commonly used in practice because it often limits the usefulness of the CORS mechanism.

3. Access-Control-Allow-Origin: example.com
	- If you specify a specific domain (e.g., "example.com"), only that domain is allowed to make cross-origin requests to the server.
	- This is a common and more secure way to configure CORS when you want to allow a specific website to access your resources but not all websites.
