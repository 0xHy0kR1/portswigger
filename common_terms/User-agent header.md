## Introduction
- a user agent header is a small piece of information that your web browser sends to websites when you visit them.
- It helps websites know what kind of device and browser you are using, so they can show you the right version of their site.
**Example** - 
when you visit a website, your browser might send a user agent header like this:
```js
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/92.0.4515.131 Safari/537.36
```

the user agent header tells the website that you are using Chrome version 92 on a Windows 10 computer. The website can then use this information to customize its content and layout to work well with your browser and device.
