- Embedded JavaScript expressions, often referred to as template literals or template strings, are a feature in JavaScript that allows you to include dynamic JavaScript code within a string.
- These expressions are enclosed within backticks (`) and can be evaluated to produce a string.

#### Example 
```js
const name = "John";
const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
```
In this example, `${name}` is an embedded JavaScript expression that evaluates the variable `name` and inserts its value into the string. The resulting value of `greeting` will be "Hello, John!".
