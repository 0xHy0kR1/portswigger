- The "X-Forwarded-Host" header is an HTTP header commonly used in web applications, particularly in scenarios where there is a reverse proxy or load balancer in front of a web server.
- Its primary purpose is to provide information about the original host requested by a client, even if the request has passed through one or more intermediate servers or proxies.

**Here's an example of what an HTTP request with the "X-Forwarded-Host" header might look like:**
```js
GET /path/to/resource HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
X-Forwarded-Host: original-host.com
```

In this example, the client originally requested "original-host.com," but the request passed through a reverse proxy or load balancer and is being sent to the backend server as "example.com." The "X-Forwarded-Host" header is used to carry the original host information.

Web servers and application frameworks can access the "X-Forwarded-Host" header to determine the original host requested by the client and take appropriate actions based on that information.
