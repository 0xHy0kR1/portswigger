- Some websites make XSS more difficult by restricting which characters you are allowed to use. This can be on the website level or by deploying a WAF that prevents your requests from ever reaching the website.
- In these situations, you need to experiment with other ways of calling functions which bypass these security measures.
- One way of doing this is to use the `throw` statement with an exception handler. This enables you to pass arguments to a function without using parentheses

**In these situations, use the payload** - 
```js
onerror=alert;throw 1
```
1. `onerror=alert;`: This part of the code assigns the `alert` function to the global exception handler. In simpler terms, it says that if there is an error or exception in the code, use the `alert` function to show a message to the user.
    
2. `throw 1`: This part of the code generates an error or exception by using the `throw` statement and passing the value `1` as the error message.

There are multiple ways of using this technique to call [functions without parentheses](https://portswigger.net/research/xss-without-parentheses-and-semi-colons).

The next lab demonstrates a website that filters certain characters. You'll have to use similar techniques to those described above in order to solve it.

## Steps to solve lab 
### Title - Reflected XSS in a JavaScript URL with some characters blocked
**Desc** - This lab reflects your input in a JavaScript URL, but all is not as it seems. This initially seems like a trivial challenge; however, the application is blocking some characters in an attempt to prevent XSS attacks.
To solve the lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that calls the `alert` function with the string `1337` contained somewhere in the `alert` message.

**Our end goal** - To solve the lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that calls the `alert` function with the string `1337` contained somewhere in the `alert` message.

1. First try to analyze the search functionality based on your input values.

The code shown above in the red block is that code that we use to exploit the web application.

2. Now, copy the below payload and paste it into the `Website` box to perform "Reflected XSS".
```python
https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/post?postId=5&%27},x=x=%3E{throw/**/onerror=alert,1337},toString=x,window%2b%27%27,{x:%27
```
When the user clicks on their name field then automatically the url executed and the "fetch" function makes the request to `postId=5&%27},x=x=%3E{throw/**/onerror=alert,1337},toString=x,window%2b%27%27,{x:%27
and the alert gets popup to the screen.
