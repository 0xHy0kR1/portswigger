## What is SQL injection?
- SQL injection is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when a malicious user injects unauthorized SQL code into a database query through a vulnerable application.

- A successful SQL injection attack can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as passwords, credit card details, or personal user information

## SQL injection examples
-   [[Retrieving hidden data]] - where you can modify a SQL query to return additional results.
-   [Subverting application logic](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection#subverting-application-logic), where you can change a query to interfere with the application's logic.
-   [UNION attacks](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/union-attacks), where you can retrieve data from different database tables.
-   [Examining the database](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/examining-the-database), where you can extract information about the version and structure of the database.
-   [Blind SQL injection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/blind), where the results of a query you control are not returned in the application's responses.
