1. Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:
	- Use parameterized queries or prepared statements with placeholders instead of concatenating user input directly into SQL queries.
	- This ensures that user input is treated as data and not executable code.

2. Input Validation and Sanitization:
	- Validate and sanitize user input to ensure it adheres to the expected format and restricts the use of characters that have special meaning in SQL.

3. Least Privilege Principle:
	- Use database accounts with minimal privileges required for the application to limit the potential damage an attacker can cause if a SQL injection vulnerability is exploited.

4. Web Application Firewalls (WAF):
	- Implement a web application firewall that can detect and block malicious SQL injection attempts.

5. Regular Updates and Security Testing:
	- Keep your application and underlying software up to date and perform regular security assessments, including vulnerability scanning and penetration testing, to identify and address potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.
