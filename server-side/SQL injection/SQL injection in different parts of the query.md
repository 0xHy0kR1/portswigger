Most SQL injection vulnerabilities arise within the `WHERE` clause of a `SELECT` query

## The most common other locations where SQL injection arises are:
- In `UPDATE` statements, within the updated values or the `WHERE` clause.
- In `INSERT` statements, within the inserted values.
- In `SELECT` statements, within the table or column name.
- In `SELECT` statements, within the `ORDER BY` clause.
