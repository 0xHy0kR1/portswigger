## Introduction
- Many applications that place user input into file paths implement some kind of defense against path traversal attacks, and these can often be circumvented.
- You might be able to use an absolute path from the filesystem root, such as `filename=/etc/passwd`, to directly reference a file without using any traversal sequences.
