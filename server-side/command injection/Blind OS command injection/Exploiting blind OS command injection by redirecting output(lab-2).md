## Introduction
- You can redirect the output from the injected command into a file within the web root that you can then retrieve using the browser.

**Example** - 
if the application serves static resources from the filesystem location `/var/www/static`, then you can submit the following input:
```python
|| whoami > /var/www/static/whoami.txt ||
```
- The `>` character sends the output from the `whoami` command to the specified file.
- You can then use the browser to fetch `https://vulnerable-website.com/whoami.txt` to retrieve the file, and view the output from the injected command.

## Steps to solve lab
