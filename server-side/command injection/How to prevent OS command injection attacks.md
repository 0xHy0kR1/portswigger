1. **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
	- Validate and sanitize all user input, including form data, URL parameters, and cookies.
	- Implement strict input validation rules to allow only expected characters and formats. Reject or sanitize any input that doesn't adhere to these rules.
2. **Use Whitelisting**:
	- Create a whitelist of allowed characters, commands, or patterns, and validate user input against this whitelist.
	- Reject any input that contains disallowed characters or patterns.
	- This approach is more secure than blacklisting specific characters or commands, as it ensures that only intended inputs are accepted.
3. **Parameterized Queries and Prepared Statements**:
	- When interacting with databases, use parameterized queries or prepared statements instead of concatenating user input directly into SQL queries.
	- This helps ensure that user input is treated as data and not executable code.
4. **Least Privilege Principle**:
	- Assign the minimum necessary permissions to the processes and services running on your system.
	- By limiting the privileges of each component, you reduce the potential damage an attacker can cause even if they manage to execute commands.
5. **Avoid Shell Execution**:
	- Whenever possible, avoid invoking system shell commands or external programs.
	- Use built-in programming language functions and libraries to perform necessary operations, as they are generally safer and less prone to injection attacks.
6. **Escape User Input**:
	- If you must use user input in shell commands, properly escape or quote the input to ensure that special characters are treated as literal values and cannot be interpreted as commands or arguments.
7. **Implement Input Validation on Server and Client-Side**:
8. **Keep Software and Libraries Updated**:
9. **Security Audits and Penetration Testing**:
	- Regularly conduct security audits and penetration tests on your applications and systems. This helps identify vulnerabilities, including command injection flaws, and allows you to address them proactively.
