## Introduction
From a security perspective, the worst possible scenario is when a website allows you to upload server-side scripts, such as PHP, Java, or Python files, and is also configured to execute them as code. This makes it trivial to create your own web shell on the server.

**Web Shell** - 
- A web shell is a malicious script that enables an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a remote web server simply by sending HTTP requests to the right endpoint.
- If you're able to successfully upload a web shell, you effectively have full control over the server.
**Example** - the following PHP one-liner could be used to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem:
```php
<?php echo file_get_contents('/path/to/target/file'); ?>
```
Once uploaded, sending a request for this malicious file will return the target file's contents in the response.

## Steps to solve lab
### Desc - Remote_code_execution_via_web_shell_upload
**Our end goal** - upload a basic PHP web shell and use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file `/home/carlos/secret`. Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.

1. Login with the given credentials.
2. Making of `shell.php` and uploading it to the vulnerable part of website.

2. navigate to `/files/avatars/shell.php` url and grab the content of a file called secret and submit it as a solution.
