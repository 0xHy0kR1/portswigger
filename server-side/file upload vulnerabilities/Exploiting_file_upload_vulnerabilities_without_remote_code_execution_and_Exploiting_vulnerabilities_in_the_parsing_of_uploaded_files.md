### Uploading malicious client-side scripts
- Although you might not be able to execute scripts on the server, you may still be able to upload scripts for client-side attacks.
**Example** - 
if you can upload HTML files or SVG images, you can potentially use `<script>` tags to create stored XSS payloads.

- If the uploaded file then appears on a page that is visited by other users, their browser will execute the script when it tries to render the page.

### Exploiting vulnerabilities in the parsing of uploaded files
- If the uploaded file seems to be both stored and served securely, the last resort is to try exploiting vulnerabilities specific to the parsing or processing of different file formats.
**Example** - 
you know that the server parses XML-based files, such as Microsoft Office `.doc` or `.xls` files, this may be a potential vector for XXE injection attacks.
