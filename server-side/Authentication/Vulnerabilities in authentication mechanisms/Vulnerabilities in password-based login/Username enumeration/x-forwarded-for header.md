- The "X-Forwarded-For" (XFF) header is an HTTP header field that is used to identify the originating IP address of a client connecting to a web server through an HTTP proxy or a load balancer.
- When a client makes an HTTP request, it typically includes the client's IP address in the "Remote Address" or "X-Forwarded-For" header field.
- However, when the request goes through a proxy server or a load balancer, the proxy or load balancer replaces the client's IP address with its own IP address and adds the client's IP address to the "X-Forwarded-For" header. This allows the server to know the original IP address of the client.

The "X-Forwarded-For" header is a comma-separated list of IP addresses, with the left-most address being the original client IP and subsequent addresses representing intermediate proxies or load balancers. For example:
```js
X-Forwarded-For: client_ip, proxy1_ip, proxy2_ip
```
