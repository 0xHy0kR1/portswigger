**The most important keys are:**
- Make sure developers and testers understand the domain that the application serves
- Avoid making implicit assumptions about user behavior or the behavior of other parts of the application.

**Here are some best practices to help you minimize the risk of such vulnerabilities:**
1. **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
	- Validate and sanitize all user inputs to ensure they conform to expected formats and do not contain malicious data. 
	- This includes checking data types, length, and format before processing them.
2. **Principle of Least Privilege:**
	- Follow the principle of least privilege, which means granting users and processes only the minimum permissions required to perform their tasks.
	- Limit access to sensitive functionality or data to authorized users only.
3. **Server-Side Validation:**
	- Always perform critical validation and business rule checks on the server-side rather than relying solely on client-side validation.
	- Client-side validation can be bypassed or manipulated, so server-side validation is essential for security.
4. **Secure Authentication and Authorization:**
	- Implement strong authentication mechanisms to verify user identities.
	- Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) where possible.
5. **Session Management:**
	- Implement secure session management to prevent session-related vulnerabilities such as session hijacking and fixation.
	- Use secure session tokens, set proper expiration times, and invalidate sessions after logout or inactivity.
6. **Error Handling:**
	- Avoid revealing sensitive information in error messages.
	- Ensure that your application provides informative but generic error messages to users, while detailed error information should be logged and monitored for debugging purposes.
