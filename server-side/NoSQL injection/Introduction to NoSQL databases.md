## NoSQL databases

   - NoSQL databases store and retrieve data in a format other than traditional SQL relational tables. They are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.
   - They have fewer relational constraints and consistency checks than SQL, and claim significant benefits in terms of scalability, flexibility, and performance.
   - Different NoSQL databases use a wide range of query languages instead of a universal standard like SQL (Structured Query Language). This may be a custom query language or a common language like XML or JSON.

## NoSQL database models

   - In order to detect vulnerabilities in a NoSQL database, it needs to understand the model framework and language.

**Some common types of NoSQL databases include:**

   - **Document stores** - 
	   - These store data in flexible, semi-structured documents.
	   - They typically use formats such as JSON, BSON, and XML, and are queried in an API or query language.
	   - Examples include MongoDB and Couchbase.
   
   - **Key-value stores** -  
	   - These store data in a key-value format.
	   - Each data field is associated with a unique key string.
	   - Values are retrieved based on the unique key.
	   - Examples include Redis and Amazon DynamoDB.
   
   -  **Wide-column stores** - 
	   - These organize related data into flexible column families rather than traditional rows.
	   - Examples include Apache Cassandra and Apache HBase.

   - **Graph databases** - 
	   - Graph databases are a type of database that use nodes (points) to represent data entities and edges (connections) to show relationships between those entities.
	   - Examples of graph databases include Neo4j and Amazon Neptune.
