## Features
**Burp Suite Professional**
- An automated vulnerability scanner
- A fuzzer/bruteforcer that isn't rate limited
- Saving projects for future use; report generation
- A built-in API to allow integration with other tools
- Unrestricted access to add new extensions for greater functionality
- Access to the Burp Suite Collaborator (effectively providing a unique request catcher self-hosted or running on a Portswigger owned server)

**Burp Suite Enterprise**
- Unlike the community and professional editions, Burp Enterprise is used for continuous scanning. It provides an automated scanner that can periodically scan webapps for vulnerabilities in much the same way as software like [Nessus](https://tryhackme.com/room/rpnessusredux) performsÂ  automated infrastructure scanning.
- Unlike the other editions of Burp Suite which allow you to perform manual attacks from your own computer, Enterprise sits on a server and constantly scans target web apps for vulnerabilities.
